# Crudworld

Inventory application project for the Odin Project.

    Started some basic work on this yesterday. Mostly just following along with the MDN express tutorial, and trimming unnecessary things.

    Basically I just need to make an app where you can create, read, update and delete data, which sounds pretty straightforward. Some of the other projects I saw were pretty uninspired, and most didn't make a lot of sense. Basically databases where anyone can come and change the data seems pretty useless, unless you lean in to it. So my app is a little game with a bunch of tamagotchi type duded that just live their lives, but anyone at anytime can kill or birth new ones. Depending on the time I wanna spend on this, I may also add player submitted items, which would be a system very similar to the vector art style of COD custom tags or whatever those were.

    I'm also considering having mild simulation elements here, but I'm really not sure how confident I am with express yet, so we will see how hard all this shit is.

    "I know" by Girls Rituals is the song of the day. Play that to get a perfect mood for this app. Fuck, maybe I'll embed it.

    Made some good progress yesterday, but had a lot of work ahead of me today. Lots and lots to learn in terms of node, express, pug, mongodb and mongoose, but as usual with programming, it does exactly what you tell it to. Once I've got a better grasp on how all this works, it'll really open up some massive possibilities. 

    Already within an hour and a half I've got the ability to add and delete cruddies done, which is techically half of the battle anyway. If this keeps going smoothly, I'll probably add various worlds for cruddies to live in, as I believe several categories is part of the outline TOP gives.

    Trying to just delete cruddies from within worlds, and this is proving to be a right nightmare.

    This project is such a mess, but it is sorta working as intended now, which is sick. Just means that I can easily improve. Also means that I'm learning lots of new stuff if I can get it working but don't have a great idea of how to use it yet.

    Lots of good progress today. Even got some solid styling and animations in.

    Would really like to get this done by the end of day friday so that I can show it off to my mom. Might just push what I've got done to heroku by the weekend. (INB4 RIP heroku)

    Since I finished this dope walking animation yesterday, I think I'll setup all the simulation stuff today, and clean up the worlds in general. Still not sure if I want the worlds to be customizable at all or even if they should be different. Should you be able to delete worlds? No idea yet. Theoretically, a lot of that wouldn't be so hard to implement.
