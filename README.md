# Crudworld

Inventory application project for the Odin Project.

September 5th, 2022

    Started some basic work on this yesterday. Mostly just following along with the MDN express tutorial, and trimming unnecessary things.

    Basically I just need to make an app where you can create, read, update and delete data, which sounds pretty straightforward. Some of the other projects I saw were pretty uninspired, and most didn't make a lot of sense. Basically databases where anyone can come and change the data seems pretty useless, unless you lean in to it. So my app is a little game with a bunch of tamagotchi type duded that just live their lives, but anyone at anytime can kill or birth new ones. Depending on the time I wanna spend on this, I may also add player submitted items, which would be a system very similar to the vector art style of COD custom tags or whatever those were.

    I'm also considering having mild simulation elements here, but I'm really not sure how confident I am with express yet, so we will see how hard all this shit is.

    "I know" by Girls Rituals is the song of the day. Play that to get a perfect mood for this app. Fuck, maybe I'll embed it.
